# MetaCOVID Dataset

## Study selection

The source dataset included 3749 trials. We excluded 3646 trials without
results. For the 103 trials with results, we screened all 155 results to
verify the publication types. We found one result (trial: NCT04399746)
denoted as “other” in the source dataset which was actually a
full-results journal article, and one result (trial: ChiCTR2000029542)
denoted as a “full-results journal article” in the source dataset which
was a “application note” and which we recoded as “other.” After recoding
these two results, we then excluded all summary results (n = 10) and
other results (n = 29), which included grey literature, conference
abstracts and presentations, research letters and notes, etc. We also
excluded two non-English results (trials: ChiCTR2000029381 and
NCT04261517) and one result for which we could not access the full-text
publication (trial: NCT04332081). Our analysis dataset comprised 87
trials with 113 results.
