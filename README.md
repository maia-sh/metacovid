# MetaCOVID Dataset

## Study selection

The source dataset included 3749 trials. We excluded 3646 trials without
results. For the 103 trials with results, we screened all 155 results to
verify the publication types in order to ensure exclusion of “other”
results beyond journal articles and preprints, such as grey literature,
conference abstracts and presentations, research letters and notes, etc.
We recoded an “application note” from a “journal article” to an “other”
result (ChiCTR2000029542: 10.1093/jmcb/mjaa014). We recoded 3 “other”
results to “journal article” (NCT04399746: no DOI; NCT04315480:
10.1101/2020.07.11.20151365; NCT04340050: 10.1111/joim.13185) and 1 to
“preprint” (NCT04340050: 10.1101/2020.06.21.20132944). After recoding
these results, we then excluded all summary results (n = 10) and other
results (n = 26). We also excluded two non-English results (trials:
ChiCTR2000029381 and NCT04261517) and one result for which we could not
access the full-text publication (trial: NCT04332081). Our analysis
dataset comprised 87 trials with 116 results.
